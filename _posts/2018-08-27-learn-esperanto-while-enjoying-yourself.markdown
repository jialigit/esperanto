Esperanto is a language used by those who like making friends from all around the world. Cause this language is truly created by human according to man-made
rules, *It* is so easy to learn and can really be a help tool language for people who want to travel around the world and do not have to learn their native tongue.

This is just a introduction passage for a series, I hope we will enjoy learning together in the future!
